## Progress reporting for a simulation run.
##
## A run launched from the Shiny app happens in a background process, so the
## filesystem is the only channel back to the Run tab. Result rows are too
## coarse a signal on their own: a method that runs in parallel collects its
## scenarios in the master and writes them in one go once the method is over,
## which makes a row-counting readout jump a whole method at a time. The
## tracker here is fed by the same per-scenario callback that drives the
## console progress bar, so the app can follow a run scenario by scenario.

#' Path of the file a run reports its progress to.
#'
#' Relative to the working directory the simulation runs in, the same
#' convention as ./results/<env>/ and ./logs/<env>/.

#'
#' @return Path of the environment's progress file.

#' Write a snapshot of how far a run has got.
#'
#' The snapshot goes to a temporary file in the same directory and is renamed
#' into place. The app polls this file about once a second while the run
#' writes it, and a rename is atomic within a filesystem, so the app never
#' reads a half-written snapshot.
#'
#' @param path Path of the progress file, see [run_progress_path()].
#' @param done Number of scenarios simulated so far.
#' @param total Number of scenarios the run covers.
#' @param case_study,method What is being simulated right now.
#'
#' @return The path, invisibly.

#' Track how many scenarios of a run have been simulated.
#'
#' `total` counts the scenarios of the whole run - every case study and
#' method it covers - whereas the callbacks that drive the console progress
#' bar count within the case study/method block being worked on: `foreach`
#' calls `.options.snow$progress` with the number of tasks finished so far,
#' and the sequential loop passes its own index. `starting()` rebases on a
#' block boundary so `tick()` can take those block-local counts and still
#' record a run-wide total.
#'
#' Creating a tracker resets the environment's progress file, so a relaunch
#' starts from zero rather than resuming whatever the previous run left.
#'
#' @param env Name of the environment being run.
#' @param total Number of scenarios the run covers.
#'
#' @return A list with `path`, `starting(case_study, method)` and `tick(n)`.
