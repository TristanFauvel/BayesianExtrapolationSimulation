## A run started from the Shiny app happens in a background process, so the
## filesystem is the only channel back to the Run tab. Result rows are too
## coarse a signal on their own: a method that runs in parallel collects its
## scenarios in the master and writes them all at once when the method is
## over, so the readout would jump a whole method at a time. The tracker
## below is fed by the same per-scenario callback that drives the console
## progress bar - foreach's .options.snow$progress, which reports the number
## of tasks finished so far within one case study/method block, and the
## sequential loop's own index.

## run_progress_path() is relative to the working directory the simulation
## runs in, the same convention as ./results/<env>/ and ./logs/<env>/.
